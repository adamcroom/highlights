    Just as Americans decided that college was essential, states began spending less on public higher education and the price of college rose. At the same time, the financial aid system, long intended to make college affordable, failed to keep up with growing student and family need. Student loans became the stopgap. And, to make matters worse, for nearly 80 percent of the public, family income declined.1

    while spending grew slowly for the state’s need-based grant program, the Wisconsin Higher Education Grant, it covered less and less of the costs of college attendance.19 That was primarily because public colleges and universities were raising tuition and other costs in order to recover the lost monies from the state.

    For each additional $1,000 received, the percentage of students who completed a bachelor’s degree on-time (in four years) went up four points.21 But more often than not, the $3,500-per-year grants the foundation offered university students, and the $1,800-per-year grants it offered two-year college students, did not change the odds of graduation very much.

    Had states been required to maintain a reasonable level of commitment (say, the ten dollars or so per $1,000 of personal income provided in 1981), the total amount states contribute to higher education today would be about $146 billion, instead of the $81 billion contributed in 2015.21 That commitment would have likely prevented the rapid increases in tuition and fees in public higher education (see fig. 1) that fueled the declining purchasing power of the Pell and the need for so many middle-class families to turn to student loans.

    We know, for example, that students from families with fewer resources are less likely to feel academically and socially part of campus life. Fewer economic resources often mean a lower likelihood of participating in extracurricular activities, visiting professors during office hours, and spending time on campus. In turn, this results in fewer opportunities to build relationships that could pave the way for social networks yielding greater returns to the college degree.47

    Too often, however, what students go through in order to pay for college is overlooked, as writers favor more simplistic ways of understanding class differences. Money, they say, is not really what matters. But in reality, money does matter—a lot. What happens in college is not simply a function of students lacking social networks, academic skills, or cultural know-how or having more commitments to work or family. It is rooted in the struggles they endure because they cannot pay for what they need and in the lengths they must go to in order to find money.

    2 The Cost and Price of a College Education
</div><div class="h2">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 685

<div class="noteText">
    The majority of costs for undergraduate education are instructional costs, directly related to teaching and learning. These include many of the things we’d expect in an educational experience, items like faculty and staff salaries, libraries, tutoring, computer labs, and academic buildings that house laboratories and classrooms. Student support services, which include academic advising, tutoring, and counseling, also fall into this category.

    The cost of attendance includes tuition and fees, books and supplies, transportation, and other living costs. But it largely excludes a hugely important factor, something economists call the opportunity cost.

    Surprisingly, tuition and fees are not the biggest price drivers. Most of these increases since 1996 came from the other parts of the cost of attendance: living costs, transportation, books and supplies, and personal expenses.

    The debates about the cost of college often dismiss the importance of addressing living costs, suggesting they aren’t really educational expenses. But students have to pay for books, food, rent, and gas if they are to have any chance of succeeding in school. Ireland and the United Kingdom recognize and address these needs with “maintenance” grants, and historically the United States has too.5 Monthly “subsistence” payments for living costs were made to veterans in the original GI Bill, and in the 1940s when veterans reported that the subsistence payments were inadequate, the government responded by increasing them.6

    Students and parents often say that the price of college is much higher than they expected. Financial aid officers, in contrast, often say that students don’t know how to live within their means or that they lack financial literacy.7 They, along with many politicians, even accuse students of “overborrowing” by taking loans to cover costs they do not face.8

    The government gives colleges and universities a great deal of latitude in how they calculate “living cost allowances.” They can ask students what it costs to live near campus, survey landlords, look at ads in the newspaper—many types of research are acceptable, and no one checks that the information is valid. While many colleges and universities understand their responsibility to provide students with accurate information, university administrations and admissions and financial aid offices face incentives to look affordable.

They also look for private sources of aid, institutional scholarships, foundation scholarships, and whatever else is available.

    Parents and their students are willing to make sacrifices. National survey data indicate that 61 percent of people in families earning less than $35,000 a year strongly agree that they are “willing to stretch myself financially” to pay for college—compared to 52 percent of middle-income families, and 58 percent of wealthy families.

    Yet when he enrolled at the university, he was placed in remedial courses in both math and writing. Ian was frustrated, believing that the year he took off between high school and college, a year he hoped would prevent him from having to work during school, caused a learning loss that led him to need remediation. Since those remedial courses did not count toward his degree, the total time he would need to remain in college was extended.

    The low degree-completion rates of our students in Milwaukee stand in stark contrast to the rest of the students in this study (more on that in the next chapter), but they are generally consistent with the pattern observed for Milwaukee college students overall, and students of color in particular. Six years after beginning college, just 41 percent of Milwaukee students in our study had completed a credential of any kind, compared to 52 percent of students in the rest of the state (table 19). They were far less likely to have completed an associate degree, whether in two years (2% in Milwaukee vs. almost 11% elsewhere) or six years (7% in Milwaukee vs. almost 24% elsewhere).

    The most important lesson this experiment taught us is that financial aid is not money. Money clearly matters a great deal to how students experience college and whether they complete degrees. The Fund for Wisconsin Scholars was smart to focus its resources on students like those in this book. They do need more resources, and when students receive them, they are helped. But, unlike cash gifts or wages, the grants and loans that make up financial aid include complex rules, procedures, and requirements. If we want to lower the price to help people focus on school and complete their degrees on time, then financial aid as it is now designed may not be the best approach.

    The price of college attendance is not merely a financial fact. It is a political fact reflecting policy choices and values. Compare the way students must pay for higher education to the way every child has access to free public K–12 education, or the way Americans access public roads, or the benefits of the fire department, which never asks you to describe your financial situation or contribute a means-tested check before putting out a blaze. College has a price and is not free today for a reason: because higher education in the United States is broadly considered a privilege and not a right.

    Also, tuition guarantees obscure an important piece of information students need to know: financial aid—especially aid from grants—often declines as students’ progress through college.

Similar programs in Arkansas were budgeted at $12.4 million and in Mississippi at $3.2 million.40 Nineteen studies of student aid policies by the Education Policy Center (located at the University of Alabama) over the past five years found that for many rural states, including the Deep South, the Pell Grant is, for all intents and purposes, the de facto state student aid program.41
