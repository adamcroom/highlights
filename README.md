### Introduction

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 59

<div class="noteText">Just as Americans decided that college was essential, states began spending less on public higher education and the price of college rose. At the same time, the financial aid system, long intended to make college affordable, failed to keep up with growing student and family need. Student loans became the stopgap. And, to make matters worse, for nearly 80 percent of the public, family income declined.1</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 161

<div class="noteText">while spending grew slowly for the state’s need-based grant program, the Wisconsin Higher Education Grant, it covered less and less of the costs of college attendance.19 That was primarily because public colleges and universities were raising tuition and other costs in order to recover the lost monies from the state.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 173

<div class="noteText">For each additional $1,000 received, the percentage of students who completed a bachelor’s degree on-time (in four years) went up four points.21 But more often than not, the $3,500-per-year grants the foundation offered university students, and the $1,800-per-year grants it offered two-year college students, did not change the odds of graduation very much.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 183

<div class="noteText">affordable, at least for people from low-income families. They are upset about loans but focus mainly on the struggle to repay them, rather than their root cause: the high price of college that makes them necessary in the first place.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 193

<div class="noteText">Improving our collective understanding of college affordability takes work—work to look beyond the published figures and media claims and get down to the real experiences of regular Americans.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 215

<div class="noteText">The last chapter of the book describes how we can do better. There are some solutions that are straightforward and could be implemented locally by colleges and universities. Others would require state or federal action.</div>

### 1 Possible Lives

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 229

<div class="noteText">A public debate is raging about the future of financial aid, with experts often trying to blame financial aid recipients rather than the system.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 230

<div class="noteText">Data on their academic performance have been used to question whether they belong in college in the first place. Data on their use of student loans have been used to question their financial literacy and how they live their lives. Data on their degree completion rates have been used to question whether the Pell Grant Program is a waste.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 254

<div class="noteText">The architects of the financial aid system did not, however, envision college as the only route out of poverty. During the same period, Congress invested in jobs programs, a safety net for those left behind, and Head Start for the children of poor families.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 262

<div class="noteText">By the time the Pell Grant was created in 1972, 80 percent of American college students were enrolled in public colleges and universities.7</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 266

<div class="noteText">Economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz have linked these major investments in public education to a growth in human capital that enabled the United States to thrive as a global economic powerhouse.9 These results would not have occurred if only the wealthiest or even only the highest-achieving students went to college.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 273

<div class="noteText">Soaring rhetoric about the value of hard work obscures the fact that family money has long been one of the best predictors of college success.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 290

<div class="noteText">Today, the share of state resources invested in higher education is about the same as it was in 1966</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 298

<div class="noteText">Had states been required to maintain a reasonable level of commitment (say, the ten dollars or so per $1,000 of personal income provided in 1981), the total amount states contribute to higher education today would be about $146 billion, instead of the $81 billion contributed in 2015.21 That commitment would have likely prevented the rapid increases in tuition and fees in public higher education (see fig. 1) that fueled the declining purchasing power of the Pell and the need for so many middle-class families to turn to student loans.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 316

<div class="noteText">For-profit colleges and universities benefit substantially, pocketing billons in federal student aid each year while producing degrees that employers value far less than community college degrees, often equating them with high school diplomas.23</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 382

<div class="noteText">All this means that college alone will not conquer inequality. But this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be doing more to realize the ideals of meritocracy and equal opportunity that launched the federal Pell program.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 392

<div class="noteText">Students from working-and middle-class families who hit the books in high school and are academically prepared for college are turning away from higher education because they cannot afford it.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 415

<div class="noteText">While the Great Recession technically lasted only nineteen months, from December 2007 to June 2009, its aftermath is widely considered to have extended for many years.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 430

<div class="noteText">Tyler Olson grew up in a small Wisconsin city banked by a river and a lake, in a community where nine in ten residents share his Anglo origins and where families like his were known for their commitment to football, wrestling, and fishing.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 451

<div class="noteText">Norbert Webster Norbert Webster was born outside of Wisconsin, but as a young child he moved north with his family to the reservation of his tribe, the Oneida.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 480

<div class="noteText">Ian Williams met with our team eight times over six years and completed every survey promptly. He explained why: “What I’m hoping to do is speak for the people who don’t have this opportunity, people who live in my community, my brothers, my family. . . . I’m going to speak for them, instead of myself.”</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 499

<div class="noteText">In 2007, Ian graduated from high school. He then spent a year working to save money and finally enrolled in college. “Somehow I managed to stay more focused on my education, and that’s why I’m here [in college] right now. . . . I’ve been through the struggle and it made me stronger.”</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 509

<div class="noteText">When she was young child in Nepal, Nima Chaudhary’s experience of grinding poverty was so severe that her parents were often forced to decide which of their children would receive an investment of the “good” food for the day. The family often lacked sufficient clothing as well.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 555

<div class="noteText">Most Pell recipients do not come from a background of generational poverty. Some come from middle-class families but don’t have either the income stability or the parental support for college that the financial aid system assumes is possible.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 559

<div class="noteText">Sophie was a small-town girl who grew up in a community of just fifteen hundred people composed almost entirely of non-Hispanic white people like herself, and she was excited about college. She was the first person in her immediate family to enroll, yet she reported, “It was kind of always assumed that after high school I would be going to go to college.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 573

<div class="noteText">Chloe Johnson was born in a small town. Port Edwards is located in central Wisconsin, with a population just under two thousand people. Each year, the town high school graduates about thirty-five students. The community grew up around a papermaking sawmill. In 2008, as Chloe began college, the sawmill closed, resulting in the loss of five hundred jobs.46</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 604

<div class="noteText">We know, for example, that students from families with fewer resources are less likely to feel academically and socially part of campus life. Fewer economic resources often mean a lower likelihood of participating in extracurricular activities, visiting professors during office hours, and spending time on campus. In turn, this results in fewer opportunities to build relationships that could pave the way for social networks yielding greater returns to the college degree.47</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 613

<div class="noteText">Too often, however, what students go through in order to pay for college is overlooked, as writers favor more simplistic ways of understanding class differences. Money, they say, is not really what matters. But in reality, money does matter—a lot. What happens in college is not simply a function of students lacking social networks, academic skills, or cultural know-how or having more commitments to work or family. It is rooted in the struggles they endure because they cannot pay for what they need and in the lengths they must go to in order to find money.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 650

<div class="noteText">most studies of financial aid, the nation’s primary investment in making college affordable, have a hard time figuring out how aid affects students’ performance in college.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 666

<div class="noteText">This was an enormously complicated undertaking, and the costs of the study were almost as large as the costs of the grants students received. Even though the students all agreed to participate, the time they committed to the study was substantial. The comments and notes we have received suggest that students understood that participating was a way to make a difference. They wanted to tell their stories.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 674

<div class="noteText">Like many Americans, they all identified as “middle class,” despite coming from families living well below the median income. They were searching for a better life, a stable job, and some security. Hard work was something they valued, and by finishing high school, completing the FAFSA, and enrolling in college they demonstrated a commitment to a brighter future. They all planned to finish college degrees.</div>

### 2 The Cost and Price of a College Education

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 685

<div class="noteText">The majority of costs for undergraduate education are instructional costs, directly related to teaching and learning. These include many of the things we’d expect in an educational experience, items like faculty and staff salaries, libraries, tutoring, computer labs, and academic buildings that house laboratories and classrooms. Student support services, which include academic advising, tutoring, and counseling, also fall into this category.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 702

<div class="noteText">The cost of attendance includes tuition and fees, books and supplies, transportation, and other living costs. But it largely excludes a hugely important factor, something economists call the opportunity cost.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 737

<div class="noteText">Surprisingly, tuition and fees are not the biggest price drivers. Most of these increases since 1996 came from the other parts of the cost of attendance: living costs, transportation, books and supplies, and personal expenses.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 740

<div class="noteText">The debates about the cost of college often dismiss the importance of addressing living costs, suggesting they aren’t really educational expenses. But students have to pay for books, food, rent, and gas if they are to have any chance of succeeding in school. Ireland and the United Kingdom recognize and address these needs with “maintenance” grants, and historically the United States has too.5 Monthly “subsistence” payments for living costs were made to veterans in the original GI Bill, and in the 1940s when veterans reported that the subsistence payments were inadequate, the government responded by increasing them.6</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 751

<div class="noteText">Students and parents often say that the price of college is much higher than they expected. Financial aid officers, in contrast, often say that students don’t know how to live within their means or that they lack financial literacy.7 They, along with many politicians, even accuse students of “overborrowing” by taking loans to cover costs they do not face.8</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 771

<div class="noteText">The government gives colleges and universities a great deal of latitude in how they calculate “living cost allowances.” They can ask students what it costs to live near campus, survey landlords, look at ads in the newspaper—many types of research are acceptable, and no one checks that the information is valid. While many colleges and universities understand their responsibility to provide students with accurate information, university administrations and admissions and financial aid offices face incentives to look affordable.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 777

<div class="noteText">Every institution must decide on and report a living cost allowance for students living off campus apart from their family. But they are not required to provide an allowance for students living with family—this</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 781

<div class="noteText">In a recent study that Robert Kelchen of Seton Hall University, Braden Hosch of Stony Brook University, and I conducted, we examined the estimated living costs, trying to understand the implications of this leeway.13</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 787

<div class="noteText">at least one-fifth of all institutions provide living allowances at least 20 percent below what we estimated was necessary for a very modest standard of living.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 797

<div class="noteText">The true cost of attendance is understated in several other ways. The most obvious reason for such underestimation is that stated tuition applies only to the upcoming year—and it is likely to change.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 802

<div class="noteText">Just 19 percent of full-time students at public universities complete a bachelor’s degree in four years and just 5 percent of full-time students at community colleges finish an associate degree in two years. Even a “one-year” certificate takes 84 percent of students more than a year to finish.15</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 809

<div class="noteText">Fees are also unpredictable. In many states, student fees are less regulated than tuition and can be used to fund an array of campus programming.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 827

<div class="noteText">the federal needs-analysis process is complicated. Indeed, the process is so complicated it is often unpopular among those who have to administer it and those who are subject to it.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 850

<div class="noteText">For students listed as dependent for financial aid purposes, parental financial resources determine the expected family contribution. But it is no surprise that many young people cannot access those resources. Parents are not legally required to pay for college, not all contribute as much money as colleges and Uncle Sam say they should, and some contribute no money at all.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 933

<div class="noteText">In practice, when a Pell is awarded but does not cover all of a student’s need, financial aid officers turn to other federal grants and then to state grants to fill the gap. When that is not enough, and it often is not, they add loans and work-study funds to the package. They also look for private sources of aid, institutional scholarships, foundation scholarships, and whatever else is available.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 968

<div class="noteText">The financial aid administrator has authority to adjust the cost of attendance for a specific student, officially known as adjusting their budget.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 970

<div class="noteText">For example, if a student faces higher childcare costs or a costly medical situation, the aid administrator might raise the budget to allow a student to take a larger loan.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 1049

<div class="noteText">In a sense, sometimes a grant acts as an increasingly small coupon that entices a student to try college, but at the end of the day leaves them with a bill they can’t afford.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 1109

<div class="noteText">That said, we found little to no evidence that students’ spending was wasteful. We analyzed budget logs and found that very little money was allocated for entertainment, alcohol, or leisure activities.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 1111

<div class="noteText">Students did not always have enough information about their overall financial aid picture to make decisions about, for example, possibly attending less expensive colleges or covering their room and board through on-campus work.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 1169

<div class="noteText">The more complicated the grant program, the less effective it seems to be, and the evidence on the effects of loans and work-study programs is much less promising than for grants.50</div>

### 3 Who Gets Pell?

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 1209

<div class="noteText">Are we doing students from low-income families a service by funding part of their college expenses or a disservice by giving them false hopes?</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 1455

<div class="noteText">that the average Pell Grant recipient looks very much like a middle-class American. What is different is the jump in attendance among Pell recipients at for-profit institutions.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 1457

<div class="noteText">A combination of declining capacity in public colleges and universities, growing interest among students in the flexibility offered by online, nonresidential education, intense marketing campaigns, and a willingness by the federal government to allow financial aid dollars to follow students wherever they attend has facilitated the growth of a robust sector of for-profit higher education.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 1573

<div class="noteText">The Pell Grant clearly provides an incentive for students to attend college by discounting the price of attendance, but it comes nowhere close to making college affordable.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 1574

<div class="noteText">There is a lot of discussion about rising tuition and fees in the public sector, but most of the growth has been in nontuition costs, which account for two-thirds or more of the total costs.</div>

### 4 Making Ends Meet

<div class="noteText">Getting a check from work-study funds first requires that the student identify and secure a work-study job.</div>

#### Bookmark - Location 2351

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 2403

<div class="noteText">The requirement that students refile the FAFSA for each year of college, even when they remain enrolled at the same institution, is part of an effort to ensure that students with need—and only students with need—receive federal grant aid.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 2425

<div class="noteText">Forty percent of our students who attended a public university saw their expected family contribution increase between their first and second year of college.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 2434

<div class="noteText">the federal needs analysis uses just a single prior year of income from tax returns, failing to make the sorts of distinctions that social scientists have repeatedly found matter to children’s educational opportunities. Families living with persistently low incomes for decades experience very different circumstances than those who suffer a temporary loss of income.</div>

### 5 On Their Own

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 2619

<div class="noteText">Twenty-four percent of our students indicated that in the past month they did not have enough money to buy food, ate less then they felt they should, or cut the size of their meals because there was not enough money</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 2705

<div class="noteText">The FAFSA recently began asking students if they were homeless—in order to say yes, students had to file paperwork to verify their claim—and in 2012–13, at least fifty-eight thousand students said</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 2776

<div class="noteText">Single Stop responds to this problem by uniting a suite of services under one roof, using a software program known as the Benefits Enrollment Network to synthesize thousands of pages of regulations and statutes into a single screening tool. After spending about fifteen minutes with a client, site staff can use this software to calculate a student’s likely eligibility for multiple public benefits, helping to ensure that they only visit other offices if those visits are likely to pay dividends.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 2782

<div class="noteText">When we asked them how they responded to students before Single Stop came to campus, their responses sometimes became emotional. Asked what he could do for students before Single Stop came to campus, one administrator simply said, “I could pray for them.”</div>

### 6 Family Matters

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 2887

<div class="noteText">Inequality grew during the economic recovery.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 3124

<div class="noteText">In “Bootstraps Are for Black Kids,” researchers Yunju Nam, Darrick Hamilton, William A. Darity Jr., and Anne E. Price,</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 3126

<div class="noteText">Black parents with more limited resources display a greater inclination to provide financial support for their children’s education than their white counterparts.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 3171

<div class="noteText">Financial aid administrators and policymakers often recommend that undergraduates live at home to save money, and more students are doing this.42</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 3178

<div class="noteText">But this advice should be qualified—there is evidence that living at home reduces the odds of becoming part of campus life, and it may even reduce the chances of graduation.44 Students who live at home during college appear more likely to experience negative relationships with parents than those who live independently.45</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 3189

<div class="noteText">The assumption that living at home is less expensive is so ingrained in our imaginations that many colleges and universities budget very little to support the living expenses of financial aid recipients living with their parents.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 3287

<div class="noteText">Parents and their students are willing to make sacrifices. National survey data indicate that 61 percent of people in families earning less than $35,000 a year strongly agree that they are “willing to stretch myself financially” to pay for college—compared to 52 percent of middle-income families, and 58 percent of wealthy families.</div>

### 7 Making the Grade

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 3464

<div class="noteText">it seems that raising the financial stakes on low-income students may cause some of them to proceed more slowly through college, potentially lengthening their time to degree (and raising their total costs) over time.</div>

<div class="noteText">Yet when he enrolled at the university, he was placed in remedial courses in both math and writing. Ian was frustrated, believing that the year he took off between high school and college, a year he hoped would prevent him from having to work during school, caused a learning loss that led him to need remediation. Since those remedial courses did not count toward his degree, the total time he would need to remain in college was extended.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 3523

<div class="noteText">And, unlike regular wages, grant money comes with rules and restrictions that limit how it can be used.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 3524

<div class="noteText">In a quasi-experimental analysis of the effects of financial aid on time use, researcher Stephen DesJardins and his colleagues found that a merit-based scholarship reduced the time undergraduates spent working and increased time spent on cultural activities and community service but had no effect on the amount of time students spent studying, relaxing, or doing other extracurricular activities.25</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 3530

<div class="noteText">An additional $1,000 of annual grant aid reduced the number of hours that students worked, on average, by only thirty-five minutes a week.27</div>

### 8 City of Broken Dreams

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 3788

<div class="noteText">While there is a great deal of attention devoted to how much states contribute overall to their public colleges and universities, there is much less discussion about how funds are distributed among those institutions.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 4159

<div class="noteText">Our data complement his and suggest that the advising needs to go further, to help students seeking degrees as they also traverse the many broken institutions in the city. Too often, researchers trying to understand problems in higher education fail to recognize that challenges created by the health and human services systems and the criminal justice system</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 4242

<div class="noteText">The low degree-completion rates of our students in Milwaukee stand in stark contrast to the rest of the students in this study (more on that in the next chapter), but they are generally consistent with the pattern observed for Milwaukee college students overall, and students of color in particular. Six years after beginning college, just 41 percent of Milwaukee students in our study had completed a credential of any kind, compared to 52 percent of students in the rest of the state (table 19). They were far less likely to have completed an associate degree, whether in two years (2% in Milwaukee vs. almost 11% elsewhere) or six years (7% in Milwaukee vs. almost 24% elsewhere).</div>

### 9 Getting to Graduation

<div class="noteText">Six years after beginning college, just one in two of the students in the Wisconsin Scholars Longitudinal Study had graduated with a credential of any kind</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 4508

<div class="noteText">Nearly half of the students offered five years of support from the Fund for Wisconsin Scholars stopped receiving the grant before three years had passed.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 4553

<div class="noteText">The most important lesson this experiment taught us is that financial aid is not money. Money clearly matters a great deal to how students experience college and whether they complete degrees. The Fund for Wisconsin Scholars was smart to focus its resources on students like those in this book. They do need more resources, and when students receive them, they are helped. But, unlike cash gifts or wages, the grants and loans that make up financial aid include complex rules, procedures, and requirements. If we want to lower the price to help people focus on school and complete their degrees on time, then financial aid as it is now designed may not be the best approach.</div>

### 10 Making College Affordable

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 4580

<div class="noteText">When nearly 75 percent of American families find college unaffordable, and the means-tested financial aid system fails to do its job even for the poorest, it is time for a change.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 4589

<div class="noteText">The first reason stems from a popular liberal myth: by targeting a social program to the poor, you will ensure they get the resources they need. This is a vastly oversimplified approach.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 4592

<div class="noteText">Directing dollars one way does not ensure their purchasing power if it does not also control costs and ensure that other subsidies remain. It also does not mean that the system is reliable, trustworthy, accessible, or even remotely transparent. The Pell Grant is targeted but it can’t promise that enough state appropriations will go to the institutions serving low-income students and it does nothing to keep college costs in check.</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 4599

<div class="noteText">Tuition and fees are called “direct educational expenses” while everything else, including food, rent, gas money, and books, is called “indirect” or “noneducational.”</div>

<div class="noteText">Today, nine of every ten students that Senator Pell’s program supports graduate from college with debt, with an average of over $30,000 per student.6</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - Location 4632

<div class="noteText">The price of college attendance is not merely a financial fact. It is a political fact reflecting policy choices and values. Compare the way students must pay for higher education to the way every child has access to free public K–12 education, or the way Americans access public roads, or the benefits of the fire department, which never asks you to describe your financial situation or contribute a means-tested check before putting out a blaze.

<div class="noteText">For example, students in a design course might assume from previous experiences that the goal of any project is simply getting a finished product that they like. With this in mind, they might focus solely on the final design or presentation. However, if the instructor’s objective is for students to develop more sophisticated process skills (for example, researching relevant design ideas to spur their creativity, recording their exploration of multiple concepts, and explaining their design choices and revisions along the way to a final product), it may be necessary not only to express these goals explicitly but also to articulate what students need to do to meet the assignment’s objectives</div>

#### Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - WHAT STRATEGIES DOES THE RESEARCH SUGGEST? > Page 207 · Location 3266

<div class="noteText">Remember that planning is extremely difficult for novices. As students gain experience, this kind of explicit modeling can be gradually removed and students can be required to develop and submit their own plan for approval.</div>
